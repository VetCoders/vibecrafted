# vetcoders-init — Memory + Eyes for AI Agents

Bootstrap an agent session with two layers of context:

- **Memory**: What was done before (ai-contexters — session history extraction)
- **Eyes**: What the code looks like now (loctree MCP — structural map)

## When To Use

Execute at the start of every session, **before any implementation work**:

- **Cold start**: First session on a repo (zero prior context)
- **Resuming after break**: Stale context after 24+ hours away
- **Subagent delegation**: Agents inherit structured context
- **Structural drift**: Major changes by others since last session

Running init is a forcing function: it prevents blind coding.

## Init Sequence

### Step 1: Extract Memory

Pull historical context from previous AI sessions for this project:

```bash
aicx all -p <project_name> --incremental
```

This extracts deduplicated, chunked timelines from Claude Code, Codex, and
Gemini sessions into `~/.ai-contexters/<project>/`. Incremental mode skips
already-processed entries.

**If no project name is obvious**, detect from repo:

```bash
PROJECT=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
aicx all -p "$PROJECT" -H 168 --incremental
```

**If aicx is not installed**, skip this step and note the gap.
Memory is valuable but not blocking.

### Step 2: Read Recent Context

Check what memory was extracted:

```bash
aicx refs -H 168 -p <project_name>
```

Read the most recent 1-2 context files to understand:

- What was the last task worked on?
- Are there open TODOs or decisions pending?
- What signals were extracted (look for `[signals]` blocks)?

### Step 3: Open Eyes (loctree MCP)

Map the current state of the codebase. Run in this order:

1. **`repo-view(project)`** — health, hubs, languages, LOC, dead exports, cycles
2. **`focus(directory)`** — for the target module(s) relevant to the task (1-3 dirs)
3. **`follow(scope)`** — if repo-view flagged signals (dead, cycles, twins, hotspots)

This gives the agent structural awareness: what files matter, what depends
on what, where the risk is.

### Step 4: Produce Situational Report (Required)

After steps 1-3, produce this situational report to stdout:

```
## Session Init: <project>

### Memory (ai-contexters)
- Last activity: <date from refs>
- Open signals: <TODOs, decisions from context files>
- Sessions extracted: <count>

### Structure (loctree)
- Files: <N>, LOC: <N>, Languages: <list>
- Health: <cycles, dead exports, twins>
- Top hubs: <top 3 files by importers>
- Target scope: <focused dirs>

### Ready
Agent has memory and eyes. Proceeding with task.
```

## For Subagent Prompts

When delegating to subagents via vetcoders-spawn, include this preamble:

```
## Context Bootstrap

Use loctree MCP tools as the primary exploration layer:
- repo-view(project) first for overview
- slice(file) before modifying any file
- find(name) before creating new symbols
- impact(file) before deleting

Historical context from previous sessions is available at:
~/.ai-contexters/<project_name>/

List available context files with:
aicx refs -p <project_name> -H 168
```

## Quick Reference

| Step    | Tool                          | What It Gives                  |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Memory  | `aicx all -p X --incremental` | Past decisions, TODOs, signals |
| Refs    | `aicx refs -H 168 -p X`       | Paths to stored context chunks |
| Eyes    | `repo-view(project)`          | Current structure + health     |
| Focus   | `focus(directory)`            | Module-level detail            |
| Signals | `follow(scope)`               | Dead code, cycles, twins       |

## Fallback

If **aicx** unavailable: skip memory steps, proceed with loctree only.
If **loctree MCP** unavailable: fall back to `loct --for-ai` CLI, then `rg --files`.
If **both** unavailable: read CLAUDE.md + README.md + recent git log. Announce gaps.

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting implementation without running init (blind coding)
- Running loctree but skipping ai-contexters (no memory of past work)
- Reading every context file (context bloat) — read only the 1-2 most recent
- Skipping repo-view and jumping to grep (no structural map)
