  Definition of Undone audit skill. Runs a systematic gap analysis across the

  governance, verifies install paths, checks SEO/discoverability, and measures
  the gap between internal capability and external visibility.

# vetcoders-dou — Definition of Undone Audit

> "Green gates are necessary, not sufficient. Runtime truth wins."
> "The engineering is done. The packaging is not."

The DoU skill answers the question no agent asks by default:
**"What remains incomplete across the entire product surface, and why?"**

This is the completion oracle described in the DoU manifesto — not a one-off report,
but a structured, repeatable audit that measures the gap between "it runs on my machine"
and "someone can buy this."

## When To Use

- Before any launch, marketplace submission, or PR announcement
- After major implementation cycles (post vetcoders-followup)
- When the team asks "are we ready?" or "co jeszcze brakuje?"
- Periodic health check (recommended: every 2 weeks)
- When the feeling of progress exceeds the reality of completion

## The Undone Matrix

Every project is scored on three axes:

| Axis                     | Question                            | Tools                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Repo Health**          | Does the code work?                 | loctree, cargo/npm, CI              |
| **Web Presence**         | Can someone find and understand it? | WebFetch, brave-search, curl        |
| **Commercial Readiness** | Can someone adopt or buy it?        | Manual checklist + automated probes |

Scoring: [OK] Production-ready | [PARTIAL] Exists but incomplete | [MISSING] Absent

## Audit Sequence

### Phase 1: Repo Governance Audit

Check repository health beyond code quality:

```
Required files:
- [ ] LICENSE (not just exists — correct license for intended use)
- [ ] README.md (with install, usage, and contributing sections)
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md (or contributing section in README)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md (or GitHub Releases with notes)
- [ ] CI configuration (.github/workflows/ or equivalent)
- [ ] Issue templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
- [ ] Security policy (SECURITY.md)
```

**Automated checks:**

```bash
# File existence
for f in LICENSE README.md CONTRIBUTING.md CHANGELOG.md SECURITY.md; do
  [ -f "$ROOT/$f" ] && echo "[PASS] $f" || echo "[FAIL] $f MISSING"
done

# CI presence
[ -d "$ROOT/.github/workflows" ] && echo "[PASS] CI workflows" || echo "[FAIL] No CI"

# Issue templates
[ -d "$ROOT/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE" ] && echo "[PASS] Issue templates" || echo "[FAIL] No issue templates"
```

**Loctree structural check:**

```
repo-view(project) → extract:
- Dead exports count (should be 0 for release)
- Cycle count (should be 0 or documented)
- Health score
```

### Phase 2: Install Path Verification

The "can a stranger use this" test:

```
For CLI tools:
- [ ] Published to package registry (crates.io / npm / PyPI)
- [ ] Version badge matches actual published version
- [ ] Install command works: cargo install <name> / npm i -g <name> / pip install <name>
- [ ] Binary runs after install without dev toolchain
- [ ] --help produces useful output
- [ ] --version matches published version

For desktop apps:
- [ ] DMG/MSI/AppImage available
- [ ] Homebrew formula or equivalent
- [ ] Code signing / notarization (macOS)
- [ ] No dev toolchain required to install

For web apps:
- [ ] URL is accessible
- [ ] Loads in <3 seconds
- [ ] Works without JavaScript (or graceful fallback message)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
```

### Phase 3: Discoverability Audit

The "can Google find us" test:

**URL Crawl (for each public URL):**

```
1. WebFetch(url, "Extract: page title, meta description, h1, main content summary,
   any CTA buttons, pricing info. Report if page appears empty or JS-only.")

2. Check for SSR/static content:
   - curl -s <url> | grep -c '<h1\|<p\|<main'
   - If count < 3 → page is likely JS-rendered and invisible to crawlers

3. Security headers:
   - curl -sI <url> | grep -i 'strict-transport\|x-frame\|content-security\|x-content-type'

4. Open Graph / social sharing:
   - curl -s <url> | grep -i 'og:title\|og:description\|og:image\|twitter:card'
```

**SEO basics:**

```
- [ ] Title tag present and descriptive (not "React App")
- [ ] Meta description present
- [ ] H1 exists and matches page purpose
- [ ] Content visible without JavaScript
- [ ] robots.txt allows indexing
- [ ] sitemap.xml exists
- [ ] No duplicate content across domains (e.g., loct.io vs loctree.io)
```

**Search presence:**

```
brave-search("<product name>") → check if product appears in top 20
brave-search("<product name> <category>") → check category ranking
brave-search("site:<domain>") → check indexed page count
```

### Phase 4: Commercial Surface Audit

The "stranger to customer" path test:

```
Discovery → Landing → Understanding → Trial → Adoption → Payment

For each stage, verify:
- [ ] Discovery: Can be found via search (Phase 3)
- [ ] Landing: Page loads, content visible, professional appearance
- [ ] Understanding: Features, use cases, and value prop are clear within 30s
- [ ] Trial: Demo, free tier, or try-before-buy available
- [ ] Adoption: Install/signup path works end-to-end
- [ ] Payment: Pricing page exists (if commercial)

Missing stages = holes in the funnel. Report each gap.
```

### Phase 5: Marketplace Readiness (if targeting Claude/AI ecosystem)

```
Claude Code Skills Marketplace:
- [ ] SKILL.md with proper frontmatter (name, version, description)
- [ ] Description contains trigger phrases (EN + PL if applicable)
- [ ] References directory with supporting docs
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (uses $ROOT or relative paths)
- [ ] Works without optional dependencies (graceful fallback)
- [ ] Tested on clean install (no assumed global state)

GitHub Marketplace / crates.io / npm:
- [ ] Package metadata complete (description, keywords, homepage, repository)
- [ ] Categories/tags set correctly
- [ ] Screenshots or demo GIF in README
- [ ] License compatible with marketplace requirements
```

## Output Format

### DoU Report (Mandatory Structure)

```markdown
# Definition of Undone: <project/ecosystem>
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Auditor: <agent identifier>

## Executive Summary
<2-3 sentences: what's the gap between code and market?>

## Undone Matrix
| Project | Repo | Web | Commercial | Critical Gap |
|---------|------|-----|------------|-------------|
| <name>  | [OK]/[PARTIAL]/[MISSING] | [OK]/[PARTIAL]/[MISSING] | [OK]/[PARTIAL]/[MISSING] | <one line> |

## Findings by Severity

### P0 — Ship Blockers
<issues that prevent any stranger from discovering/using the product>

### P1 — Credibility Gaps
<issues that make the product look unfinished or untrustworthy>

### P2 — Polish Items
<nice-to-have improvements for professional appearance>

## The Funnel Test
Discovery → Landing → Understanding → Trial → Adoption → Payment
<for each product, mark where the funnel breaks>

## Hydration Priorities
<ordered list of what to fix first, with estimated effort>

## Plague Score
<0-100: how affected is this project by the Always-in-Production Plague?>
0 = fully shipped and discoverable
100 = technically brilliant, commercially invisible
```

## Integration with VetCoders Pipeline

```
Phase 1 — Build:     init → workflow → followup
                                         ↓
Phase 2 — Converge:                  marbles ↻ (loop until P0=P1=P2=0)
                                         ↓
Phase 3 — Ship:                      dou → hydrate
```

DoU findings feed directly into `vetcoders-hydrate` as prioritized tasks.

## Anti-Patterns

- Running DoU only on code (it's a PRODUCT surface audit, not a code audit)
- Treating [OK] repo health as proof of readiness (the whole point of DoU)
- Auditing without actually crawling URLs (trust no assumption)
- Skipping the install path test ("it works on my machine" is the plague)
- Reporting without severity ranking (everything feels equally important)
- Not re-running after hydration (verify the fix)

## The Plague Diagnostic

If you observe this pattern, the project has the plague:

1. Tests pass [PASS]
2. Architecture is sound [PASS]
3. README exists [PASS]
4. Nobody can find it from Google [FAIL]
5. Nobody can install it without a toolchain [FAIL]
6. Nobody can pay for it [FAIL]

Items 4-6 are the Definition of Undone.
